    "description": "Svevo*Zavitan introgression lines is a sequenced what population harbours wild alleles from the wild emmer wheat (Zavitan) on the genetic background of an elite durum line (Svevo). We screen this population for water stress tolerance and analyzed the image data with PhenoImage GUI software was used for image processing (Zhu et al., 2020). We extracted the key morphological traits derived from RGB images included PSA, plant height and width, plant architecture (convex area), plant density, and water-use efficiency (WUE) on the final day of the experiment. Plant height and plant width were calculated from plant dimensions. Plant architecture (convex area) was calculated to predict plant architecture trajectory. Density was calculated based on the ratio between pixel sum and plant architecture. The relative growth rate (RGR) was calculated by dividing daily pixel accumulation with pixel numbers from the previous day. Daily water-use efficiency (WUEt) was calculated as described by Momen et al. (2019), where (t) represents the day.",

Modern vehicles with features like Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) feature a rich set of sensors and drive-by-wire mech- anisms. The presented stages of data collection begins with the analysis of raw data provided by various vehicles, and eventually results in spoofing Controller Area Network (CAN) protocols for sending control commands to operate a vehicle. This paper covers the data and technical efforts needed at various stages. The raw data and tools to plot the data are also publicly available.",

G2F is an umbrella initiative to support translation of maize genomic information for the benefit of growers, consumers and society. This public-private partnership is building on publicly funded corn genome sequencing projects to develop approaches to understand the functions of corn genes and specific alleles across environments. Ultimately this information will be used to enable accurate prediction of the phenotypes of corn plants in diverse environments. There are many dimensions to the over-arching goal of understanding genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions, including which genes impact which traits and trait components, how genes interact among themselves (GxG), the relevance of specific genes under different growing conditions, and how these genes influence plant growth during various stages of development.",

    "description": "Data types in this directory tree are: hybrid and inbred agronomic and performance traits; inbred genotypic data; and environmental data collected from the Genomes To Fields (G2F) project cooperators.  G2F is an umbrella initiative to support translation of maize genomic information for the benefit of growers, consumers and society. This public-private partnership is building on publicly funded corn genome sequencing projects to develop approaches to understand the functions of corn genes and specific alleles across environments. Ultimately this information will be used to enable accurate prediction of the phenotypes of corn plants in diverse environments. There are many dimensions to the over-arching goal of understanding genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions, including which genes impact which traits and trait components, how genes interact among themselves (GxG), the relevance of specific genes under different growing conditions, and how these genes influence plant growth during various stages of development.",
