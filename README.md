# Data Commons
This is a replacement for the CyVerse Data Commons based on CKAN.

Large scale data repositories that are hosted in commercial cloud are common for NIH, NASA funded projects, analysis performed with these data sets with private local data is a regular occurrence.

Eventually the final results have to be made public, sharing these multiple data sources and analysis in a unified form are a fairly challenge for most projects. We will create a novel protocol that will allow labs to create their own data commons that can be customized for their projects and meet federal data sharing requirements.
