    "description": "Svevo*Zavitan introgression lines is a sequenced what population harbours wild alleles from the wild emmer wheat (Zavitan) on the genetic background of an elite durum line (Svevo). We screen this population for water stress tolerance and analyzed the image data with PhenoImage GUI software was used for image processing (Zhu et al., 2020). We extracted the key morphological traits derived from RGB images included PSA, plant height and width, plant architecture (convex area), plant density, and water-use efficiency (WUE) on the final day of the experiment. Plant height and plant width were calculated from plant dimensions. Plant architecture (convex area) was calculated to predict plant architecture trajectory. Density was calculated based on the ratio between pixel sum and plant architecture. The relative growth rate (RGR) was calculated by dividing daily pixel accumulation with pixel numbers from the previous day. Daily water-use efficiency (WUEt) was calculated as described by Momen et al. (2019), where (t) represents the day.",

Modern vehicles with features like Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) feature a rich set of sensors and drive-by-wire mech- anisms. The presented stages of data collection begins with the analysis of raw data provided by various vehicles, and eventually results in spoofing Controller Area Network (CAN) protocols for sending control commands to operate a vehicle. This paper covers the data and technical efforts needed at various stages. The raw data and tools to plot the data are also publicly available.",

G2F is an umbrella initiative to support translation of maize genomic information for the benefit of growers, consumers and society. This public-private partnership is building on publicly funded corn genome sequencing projects to develop approaches to understand the functions of corn genes and specific alleles across environments. Ultimately this information will be used to enable accurate prediction of the phenotypes of corn plants in diverse environments. There are many dimensions to the over-arching goal of understanding genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions, including which genes impact which traits and trait components, how genes interact among themselves (GxG), the relevance of specific genes under different growing conditions, and how these genes influence plant growth during various stages of development.",

    "description": "Data types in this directory tree are: hybrid and inbred agronomic and performance traits; inbred genotypic data; and environmental data collected from the Genomes To Fields (G2F) project cooperators.  G2F is an umbrella initiative to support translation of maize genomic information for the benefit of growers, consumers and society. This public-private partnership is building on publicly funded corn genome sequencing projects to develop approaches to understand the functions of corn genes and specific alleles across environments. Ultimately this information will be used to enable accurate prediction of the phenotypes of corn plants in diverse environments. There are many dimensions to the over-arching goal of understanding genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions, including which genes impact which traits and trait components, how genes interact among themselves (GxG), the relevance of specific genes under different growing conditions, and how these genes influence plant growth during various stages of development.",

    "description": "The images collected here could potentially help the development of new crop growth models for proso, pearl, foxtail and Japanese millet and teff. Therefore these images can be used to match the predictions from the growth models for plant height and leaf count and area. The plant height obtained for all three maize genotypes were within the same range for the same time period found in a previous study. Also, with the availability of crop models described for maize, these images could be analyzed using maize crop models to test how translatable is such model to the other grasses imaged here. This test allows us to assess how broad or specific the crop growth models for maize are, and if they could be used to predict the growth models of other related grasses in this study. The data obtained for both maize and sorghum can be used to test how well previous growth models of these plants predict what was collected in this study, helping validate such models. Obtaining image data for crops for a long period of time can be challenging, which could limit the amount of information available to test new methods. For this reason, the present dataset can be used in the development of new methods to estimate different plant traits.",

There are many dimensions to the over-arching goal of understanding genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions, including which genes impact which traits and trait components, how genes interact among themselves (GxG), the relevance of specific genes under different growing conditions, and how these genes influence plant growth during various stages of development.",

    "description": "We are uploading the phenotypic (plant height, dry biomass yield) and genotypic data files used in the publication: Novel Bayesian networks for genomic prediction of dynamic traits in biomass sorghum (dos Santos et al. 2019). Briefly, we genotyped the sorghum diversity panel using the genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) procedure based on the PstI-HF/HinP1I and PstI-HF/BfaI restriction enzymes. The sequence reads were generated (100 bp length) on a HiSeq 4000 sequencer. Sequence reads were aligned to the Sorghum bicolor genome v3.1 (www.phytozome.jgi.doe.gov). The TASSEL 3 GBS pipeline (www.bytebucket.org/tasseladmin/tassel-5-source) was then used to call variants. The genotypic data file contain the (100,435 loci) variants already processed.",

G2F is an umbrella initiative to support translation of maize genomic information for the benefit of growers, consumers and society. This public-private partnership is building on publicly funded corn genome sequencing projects to develop approaches to understand the functions of corn genes and specific alleles across environments. Ultimately this information will be used to enable accurate prediction of the phenotypes of corn plants in diverse environments. There are many dimensions to the over-arching goal of understanding genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions, including which genes impact which traits and trait components, how genes interact among themselves (GxG), the relevance of specific genes under different growing conditions, and how these genes influence plant growth during various stages of development.",

    "description": "The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) and Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) announce the public data release of the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) 1-mm 2017 observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).  The overall goal of the observations is to image the supermassive black holes M87* and Sagittarius A* at event horizon scales and to image the AGNs OJ287, 3C279, CENA, and NGC1052 at high resolution.  This data delivery contains what is defined by the EHTC as L1 data for the 2017 observing campaign.  The 2017 campaign was the first where the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) participated as a phased array, a capability that was developed by the ALMA Phasing Project.  The EHT L1 data encompasses the VLBI correlator output, converted into circular polarization basis, as well as the calibration information from the participating telescopes.  For ALMA this includes their quality assurance (QA2) output that is used for the polarization basis conversion.  The primary reference for the data from the EHT 2017 April observation campaign is Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al.  2019, ApJL, 875, L3 (doi: 10.3847/2041-8213/ab0c57) which in detail discusses the processing carried out for the current L1 data delivery.  For scientific results derived from the EHT 2017 April Observation Campaign see eventhorizontelescope.org/publications.  Additional data products derived from this L1 data can be found at eventhorizontelescope.org/for-astronomers/data.  This data delivery includes observations from  the following facilities: ALMA, the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX), the Submillimeter Telescope (SMT), the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), the Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano (LMT), the IRAM 30m telescope, the Submillimeter Array (SMA), and the South Pole Telescope (SPT).  More information about these facilities can be found in Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019, ApJL, 875, L2 (doi: 10.3847/2041-8213/ab0c96).",

These data are the calibrated visibilities from the Event Horizon Telescope observations of Centaurus A from April 10, 2017 for both \"low\" and \"high\" bands, centred around 227.1 GHz and 229.1 GHz, respectively. Data from the 2017 observations were processed through three independent reduction pipelines (Blackburn et al. 2019, Janssen et al. 2019, EHTC et al. 2019). This release includes the fringe fitted, a-priori calibrated, and network calibrated \"casa\" and \"hops\" data from the rPICARD and EHT-HOPS pipelines, respectively. Independent flux calibration is performed based on estimated station sensitivities during the campaign (Issaoun et al. 2017, Janssen et al. 2019). A description of the data properties, their validation, and estimated systematic errors is given in EHTC et al. (2019) with additional details in Wielgus et al. (2019).

To support the physical interpretation and modeling, the EHT Collaboration partnered with several international facilities in space and on the ground, to arrange an extensive, quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength (MWL) campaign. We release the processed data from MWL observations of M87 in easily downloadable formats, as a legacy product of the EHT 2017 campaign on M87. In the paper associated with this data release,  The EHT MWL Science Working Group et al. (2021), we present the most complete simultaneous, MWL spectrum of the active nucleus to date, as well as discuss the complexity and caveats of combining data from different spatial scales into a single broadband spectrum. In addition to the MWL spectrum as the primary data product, we also release machine-readable versions of other tables presented in the Appendix of the paper, intermediate data products of the X-ray analysis, and sampled posteriors of X-ray and MWL model parameters. A brief description of MWL observations and data processing is provided within the repository with further details presented in the associated paper.

To support the physical interpretation and modelling, the EHT Collaboration partnered with several international facilities in space and on the ground, to arrange an extensive, quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength (MWL) campaign. We release the processed data from MWL observations of Sgr A* in easily downloadable formats, as a legacy product of the EHT 2017 campaign on Sgr A*. In the paper associated with this data release, The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. (2022b), we present a simultaneous, MWL spectral energy distribution (SED) of Sgr A*. In addition to the MWL SED as a machine-readable table, we release the X-ray light curves observed during the campaign, intermediate data products of the X-ray analysis, and sampled posteriors of X-ray model parameters. A brief description of MWL observations and data processing is provided within the repository with further details presented in the associated paper. Please cite both the paper and the repository if using these data products in your publication.",

Data stored in this repository includes increment cores from 1558 trees, most of which were sampled during periodic inventories, from tally trees, site trees, or representative trees adjacent to FIA plots. Of these trees with increment cores, many were in plots carried over to the annual design, but others were orphaned after the implementation of the annual design in 1999. ",

    "description": "Viruses play an important role in the ecology and biogeochemistry of marine ecosystems. Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are critically important to marine nitrogen cycling and global climate change. The microbial communities and their metabolic capabilities in these anoxic zones are relatively well-studied, while less is known about the role of viruses in shaping metabolic networks and ecological dynamics along redox gradients associated with OMZs. We identified over 46,000 unique viral populations (\u2265 5kb) in 22 deeply sequenced seawater samples from 6 stations along a gradient of distinct oceanographic features in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) OMZ. Viral communities clustered into 6 groups that corresponded to distinct oceanographic features, with 3 clusters representing samples from anoxic waters. This exceeds the number of viruses previously recovered from the ETSP by at least an order of magnitude. Identified viral genomes among these communities encoded six N-cycle AMGs associated with denitrification, nitrification assimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrite transport. The majority of these AMGs (80%) were identified in large-genome T4-like Myoviridae phages, predicted to infect Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria, or in unclassified archaeal viruses predicted to infect Thaumarchaeota.",

Also included is field level weather and soil data for the multiple locations where field testing were conducted. Data was collected by collaborators in the Genomes to Fields (G2F) initiative.  G2F is an umbrella initiative to support translation of maize (Zea mays) genomic information for the benefit of growers, consumers and society. This public-private partnership is building on publicly funded corn genome sequencing projects to develop approaches to understand the functions of corn genes and specific alleles across environments. Ultimately this information will be used to enable accurate prediction of the phenotypes of corn plants in diverse environments. There are many dimensions to the over-arching goal of understanding genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions, including which genes impact which traits and trait components, how genes interact among themselves (GxG), the relevance of specific genes under different growing conditions, and how these genes influence plant growth during various stages of development.",

The objective of the survey was to develop a rich database of fungal and bacterial communities using DNA sequencing based assays across agronomically relevant locations of the US. This data may be used to understand the variation in microbial populations across locations and could provide important supporting data for scientist in different fields of research. Multiple soil and whole plant samples with attached rhizosphere were collected from G2F maize trials to support indigeneity data generation. Sample processing was completed with the primary goal of developing a reference sequences database of indigeneity data. Finally, a DNA sample repository was created to enable future work and public access.",

Data from https://www.imicrobe.us/#/projects/265  The raw sequence data from the staggered mock community (SRP115095 in project accession PRJNA397434) were used to develop simulated metagenomes. We used the known staggered mock community abundance profile to generate a simulated metagenome using GemSim (454 sequencing) with 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 million reads based on the relative abundance of organisms in the staggered mock community. We developed four simulated metagenomes to test the effect of changing the dominant organism abundance and genetic composition including: 10 million reads from the staggered mock community (mock 1), the mock community with alterations in a few abundant species (mock 2), the mock community with many alterations in abundant species (mock 3), and mock 3 with additional sequences from archaea to further alter the genetic composition (mock 4). The same community profiles were used to generate paired-end illumina dataset (100 million reads), using GemSim (illumina v4 error model). Finally, using SimLord, the community profiles were used to generate simulated third generation sequencing datasets (Pacific Bioscience SMRT sequencing - 1 million reads). SimLord default parameters were used to generate those simulated datasets.",

    "description": "Protein thermostability is important for fitness, but it is difficult to measure stability for every protein in the proteome. Fortunately, protein thermostability is correlated with prokaryotic species\u2019 optimal growth temperature (OGT), which can be predicted from other genome features. The link between sequence features, OGT, and protein stability makes it possible to build models that predict protein stability from protein amino acid sequences. Such prediction models are particularly useful for eukaryotic species, which have large proteomes with limited annotation. Models that can predict temperature sensitivity across the prokaryote-eukaryote divide would help inform how eukaryotes adapt to elevated temperatures, such as those predicted by climate change models. In this study we test whether prediction models can cross the prokaryote-eukaryote divide to predict both prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein stability. We compare models built using a) the whole proteome, b) Pfam domains, and c) individual amino acid residues. Proteome-wide models accurately predict prokaryote optimal growth temperatures (r2 up to 0.93), while site-specific models demonstrate that nearly half of the proteome is associated with optimal growth temperature in both Archaea and Bacteria. Comparisons with the small number of eukaryotes with temperature sensitivity data suggest that site-specific models are the most transferable across the prokaryote-eukaryote divide. Using the site-specific models, we evaluated temperature sensitivity for 323,850 amino acid residues in 2,088 Pfam domain clusters in Archaea and Bacteria species separately. 190,063 residues (58.7%) are significantly associated with OGT in Archaea species and 244,256 residues (75.4%) are significantly associated with OGT in Bacteria species at a 5% false discovery rate. These models make it possible to understand which Pfam domains and amino acid residues are involved in temperature adaptation and facilitate future research questions about how species will fare in the face of increasing environmental temperatures.",

After filtering out SNPs with missing data rate >80% and minor allele frequency < 0.5%, missing SNP calls were imputed with fastPHASE.  Then the whole 962 panel was split into two dataset, one with 229 accessions as the training set and another with 663 as the validation set. The training set was extensively phenoytped in multiple years and locations and used to build genomic prediction model. The genomic prediction models were then used to predict the trait values for the 663 validation set. Then a subset of 200 accessions from the 663 validation set was planted to test the prediction model. The observed phenotypes are the BLUP estimates from multiple replications, years and locations.",

    "description": "This directory includes image data collected from 155 maize plants over 32 days representing 32 maize inbreds which were also grown across the USA for field phenotyping as part the of the Genomes to Fields (G2F) project. Plants were grown and data collected at the University of Nebraska Automated Greenhouse facility in Fall 2015. Each imaging time point included data from four different types of cameras: RGB, Hyperspectral, Fluorescent, and Thermal IR. Plant water consumption was digitally recorded each day using changes in pot weight.  The genotypes imaged here are linked with ground truth data collected from the same plants, field phenotyping data from the same plant varieties grown in multiple states in multiple years (https://doi.org/10.7946/P2V888, https://doi.org/10.7946/P24S31), and GBS-based genotype calls (G2F: https://doi.org/10.7946/P2V888, Romay MC et al.(2013): DOI: 10.1186/gb-2013-14-6-r55). Because plant phenomics is an emerging area, it is hoped that the prepublication release of these novel data types will encourage the development of new image analysis methods in the emerging field of plant phenomics as well as new models for connecting phenotypic data across multiple environments.",

    "description": "In order to safeguard feeding the growing human population, it is important to understand and exploit the genetic basis of quantitative traits. Next-generation sequencing technology has shown an effective performance advantage in genetic mapping and genome analysis of diverse genetic resources. In this study, we generated an ultra-high-density map which contains 1,151,856 of high quality SNPs between Mo17 and B73 and further verified in maize intermated B73 and Mo17 (IBM) Syn10 population to well complement the existing database. Moreover, combined with IBM Syn4 RIL population, we detected 135 QTLs for flowering time and plant height traits across two populations. Eighteen functional known genes and twenty-five candidate genes for flowering time and plant height trait were fine mapped into 2.21-4.96 Mb interval. Map expansion and segregation distortion were also analyzed, and evidence for inadvertent selection of early flowering time in the process of mapping population development were observed. Furthermore, an updated integrated map with 1,151,856 high quality SNPs, 2,916 traditional markers and 6,618 bin markers was constructed. The data was deposited into the iPlant Discovery Environment (DE) which provides a fundamental source of genetic data for maize genetic community in future.",

    "description": "The folder contains images and data sets of pot and field experiments. For DIRT_Cassava_pot.csv and Cassava_pot_Images file: The pot experiment was conducted at Mahidol University(Salaya campus) in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. The stem cuttings were placed vertically in the soil such that two-thirds of the stem was below the soil line. We used 24-cm-tall white plastic pots with a diameter of 25 cm at the top and 17 cm at the bottom. Each pot contained 5 kg of organic growth media containing rain tree leaf soil and bamboo soil (1 : 1 volume ratio). Water-holding capacity was measured and processed as described by Noggle and Wynd (1941), and it was calculated as the percentage from the ratio of mass of the water in saturated soil to the mass of the saturated soil. The soil in each pot was saturated with water and drained for a day to evaluate percentage of soil water content that was determined by gravimetric measurement (Evett, 2008). We found that the water-holding capacity in the pot system was 52.48% and the soil water content was 83%. We planted five biological replicates under well-watered and drought conditions. The plants were placed outside for 30 days and were watered every other day with 1 L of water. Twenty-four days after planting (DAP), 20 g of fertilizer containing 16% each of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (16-16-16) per pot was applied. According to Adu et al. (2018), cassava has the highest relative growth rate during the first 30 DAP and the growth rate is subsequently decreased until nearly constant after 30 to 60 DAP; therefore, drought treatment was applied at 30 DAP to allow time for plants to acclimate to the system and yield information relevant to developmental processes. All plants were transferred into a growth shelter made of transparent plastic sheets to protect the plants from rainwater. To simulate drought conditions, half of the plants received no water from 30 to 90 DAP, after which they were harvested and phenotyped. The total amount of water that the plants received in the well-watered and drought treatments were approximately 45 L and 15 L, respectively. Soil water content decreased to 46.95% and 28.36% at seven and 14 days after drought treatment, respectively. At this time, the plants showed significant reduction in height and number of leaves under drought in all genotypes.  For DIRT_Cassava_field.csv and Cassava_field_image file; The field experiment was conducted at the Rayong Field Crops Research Center, Mueng, Rayong, Thailand.Three genotypes (R5, R9, and R11) were planted under well-watered and drought treatments between April 2016 to April 2017. The total amount of rainfall during this experiment was 1714.3 mm. Each plot had 700 plants, and seven replicates were harvested in this trial. The distance between rows and between plants was 1 m. The plants were watered once per week in the first two months. We followed the fertilization regime recommended by the Thailand Department of Agriculture. This regime applies 87.5 kg.ha?1 of urea, 54.81 kg.ha?1 of diammonium phosphate (18-46-0), and 271.56 kg.ha?1 of potassium chloride (0-0- 60). After two months of growth, well-watered plants received irrigated water every other day, while the drought treatment plants were rainfed and did not receive additional water. Shoot and root traits were quantified at 10 months (first trial) and 12 months (second trial) after planting.",

    "description": "Background. The phyllosphere hosts a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, that can play a positive or negative role in the success of the host plant. Bacterial communities in the phylloplane are influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors and develop over time into specific community compositions. We examined community structure changes in epiphytic leaf microbial samples from different plant leaf ages and determined key drivers of microbe community structure and development. Methods. A combination of ribosomal (ARISA) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) direct imaging strategies were used to assess microbial community composition across maize plant ages, using a novel and powerful staggered planning design. This data object contains separate sections for each data type, with the raw data files, the intermediate files from analysis steps, and the output files listing microbial abundances at each stage. There is a metadata file for each datatype, listing specifics such as column headers. For ARISA, the raw data is the peak height of specific size classes of ribosomal intergenic spacer PCR products, which are then organized into a species-sample matrix and relative abundances output. For SEM images, microbes were traced manually (and the trace files included in this data object), then the sizes were binned to create a size-based operational taxonomic unit by sample matrix. The output is abundance of each binned taxonomic unit in each sample. ",

Most studies of computational methods for gene expression analysis use simulated data to evaluate the accuracy of these methods. In this work we present a dataset of 3 tissues each containing 10 samples of simulated short RNA-seq reads across 4 types of transcription characterized from the GTEx dataset. For each type of transcription: 1) known isoforms; 2) splicing noise; 3) intronic noise; 4) intergenic noise -we provide sets of reads in CRAM format along with corresponding expression matrices and annotations in the GTF format for downstream analysis. A copy of GRCh.38 used in our analysis is also provided along with the simulated data. Further details on the structure of each file is provided in the accompanying README document.",

The liquid samples were initially passed through polycarbonate 0.2-\u03bcm-pore-size filters to remove cells and particles with sizes exceeding 0.22 \u03bcm. Viruses in the filtrate were concentrated and used for isolating their DNA, which were then sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform to generate the metaG reads. The uploaded \u2018.gz\u2019 data were quality-controlled reads, which can then be used for assembly to generate viral contigs/genomes, and for further investigation of viral community and diversity.",

Data were generated from association analyses of ~4,000 mass spectrometry features with ~80M single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers with the generalized linear model implemented in the FastGLM pipeline, and filtered by statistical significance of association (-log(p) > 5). This dataset allows colleagues in the maize genetics and biochemistry field to quickly identify high-resolution genetic loci that are significantly associated with biochemical traits of interests, and generate testable hypothesis to infer the genetic regulation of these traits. In addition, files in the Raw_MS_Files sub-directory contains raw liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) result files generated by a ThermoQ-Exactive Plus system, organized into further subfolders based on the type of biological tissues and modes of electron spray ionization. The Raw_MSMS_Files sub-directory contains raw LC tandem MS result files generated by the same Thermo Q-Exactive Plus system with the same LC inlet gradient. For more details, see readme.txt.",
